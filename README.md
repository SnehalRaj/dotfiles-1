Also contains:
oh-my-zsh folder and zsh-custom folder and some shell scripts
My zsh-custom contains a custom theme which is heavily inspired by liquid prompt
and adjusts itself as per width of the terminal. Displaying lots of data on a larger
terminal and lesser data on a smaller terminal.

* install.sh : installs my dotfiles
* uninstall.sh : uninstalls my dotfiles
* zsh.sh : nifty script for battery monitoring on my zsh rprompt
